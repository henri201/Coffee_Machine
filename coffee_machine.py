        Print report.
a. When the user enters “report” to the prompt, a report should be generated that shows
the current resource values. e.g.
Water: 100ml
Milk: 50ml
Coffee: 76g
Money: $2.5
4. Check resources sufficient?
a. When the user chooses a drink, the program should check if there are enough
resources to make that drink.
b. E.g. if Latte requires 200ml water but there is only 100ml left in the machine. It should
not continue to make the drink but print: “Sorry there is not enough water.”
c. The same should happen if another resource is depleted, e.g. milk or coffee.
